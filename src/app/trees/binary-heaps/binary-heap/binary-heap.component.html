  Binary Heaps add nodes from left to right, if the node to be added is greater than the parent
  node then it swaps until its not.
</p>
<p>
  For <strong>Max Binary Heaps</strong> the parent nodes are always greater than the children
</p>
<p>
  For <strong>Min Binary Heaps</strong> the parent nodes are always less than the children
</p>
<p>
  At most, two children, hence Binary. Unlike a BST there is no order from left to right just up and down
</p>
<p>
  Tries to be as balanced as possibly, will add values from left to right
</p>
<p>
  Store the data in an array, as the tree is meant to be balanced. Use the formula Math.floor(2n + 1) to find the child node
</p>
<p>
  For any index of <strong>n</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Left child is stored at <strong>2n + 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Right child is stored at <strong>2n + 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Simple analysis: The size <strong>N</strong> of a full (more than just a complete) binary tree of height h is always N = 2<sup>(h+1)</sup>-1, therefore h = log<sub>2</sub>(N+1)-1 ~= log<sub>2</sub> N.

    parent(i) = i&gt;&gt;1, index i divided by 2 (integer division),

  <li>
    left(i) = i&lt;&lt;1, index i multiplied by 2,

  <li>
    right(i) = (i&lt;&lt;1)+1, index i multiplied by 2 and added by 1.
